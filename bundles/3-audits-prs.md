# Bundle 3 — Audits & PRs

You are running the Night Shift **Audits & PRs** bundle on this repository.

## Setup
First, read `CLAUDE.md` for the **Night Shift Config** section: test command, build command, default branch, push protocol, key pages, and the project's task subset.

## Tasks
Each task creates its **own branch** and its **own PR**. They are fully independent — order does not matter for correctness. Execute them sequentially (08 → 09 → 10 → 11), but isolate them: before starting each task, return to the default branch and ensure the working tree is clean.

## Execution rules
- For each task: fetch the file, read it, execute it exactly as written (including branch creation, test/build verification, and `gh pr create`).
- Before starting each task: `git checkout <default-branch> && git pull` and confirm the working tree is clean.
- If the project's Night Shift Config excludes a task, skip it and move on.
- If a task says "exit silently" (no real issues found, or a similar PR already open), continue with the next task.
- One task failing or exiting must **not** stop the bundle — continue with the remaining tasks.
